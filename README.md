# Zerodha Frontend Clone

This is my attempt at building a **frontend clone of Zerodha**, the popular trading platform.  
It’s a work in progress — not everything is complete yet, but I wanted to share it anyway.

---

## Features

- Responsive layout inspired by Zerodha’s UI  
- Header and navigation components  
- Dashboard-style interface for trading (UI only for now)  
- Basic forms for searching stocks and entering information  
- Some features like charts and real trading functionality are **not implemented yet**

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** (JavaScript)  
- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
- **Bootstrap** for styling

---

## How to Run Locally

1.Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/SanikaGadge84/zerodha-frontend-clone.git

2.Go into the project folder:

    cd zerodha-frontend-clone

3.Install dependencies:

    npm install

4.Start the development server:

    npm start





## Future Plans

This project is far from finished. Some things I plan to add next:

- Real-time stock charts
- Connecting the UI to real or mock APIs
- Better responsiveness and styling
- Unit tests for components
